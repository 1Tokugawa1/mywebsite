    <h2>About Me</h2>
   <img src="fly.jpg" alt="Profile picture" class="responsive-image" />
    <p>
      I'm an IT specialist with a strong foundation in technical support, networking, cybersecurity, and AI product development. I have a deep passion for creating tools and systems that make life more efficient and productiveâ€”particularly in education and emerging markets where the right technology can be truly transformative. 
    </p>
    <p>
      With hands-on experience in solving real-world tech challenges, Iâ€™m constantly inspired to build solutions that are not only innovative but also practical and accessible. I thrive at the intersection of curiosity, functionality, and purposeâ€”bringing value through every line of code and every system deployed.
      <br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      I grew up in Lagos, Nigeria, and have traveled across various parts of Africa, gaining a rich perspective on the diverse tech needs of different communities. Now living in New Mexico, I bring this global awareness into every project I pursue. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      My passion lies in product development and computer tinkeringâ€”exploring how hardware and software come together to solve real-world problems. Whether itâ€™s building a web tool, managing a Linux system, or prototyping a new device, I approach each challenge with curiosity and determination to create something meaningful.
