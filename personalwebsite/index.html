        Iâ€™m a Web Developer, IT Specialist, and devoted Computophile, driven by a deep passion for creating meaningful technologiesâ€”tools that simplify life, enhance productivity, and expand access to opportunity, particularly in education and underserved markets. My foundation in technical support and troubleshooting, combined with hands-on experience in Linux system administration, equips me to confidently maintain and optimize the digital environments that people depend on every day.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am also well-versed in building and maintaining networks. About a year ago, I began developing web applications using JavaScript. With CompTIA Network+ and Fibre Optic Networking certifications, I am the kind of professional equipped to oversee complex infrastructuresâ€”delivering solutions that are secure, scalable, and thoughtfully executed. Whether through web design, JavaScript programming, or 3D printing and modeling, I enjoy bridging creative and technical disciplines to solve real-world problems.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Most recently, I completed an intensive eight-week program at MIT on Designing and Building AI Products. I have been actively building and prototyping innovative solutions since. My vision is to become a leading force in AI product development, applying my skills to create impactful technologies tailored to the needs of emerging economies. Iâ€™m especially passionate about using technology to improve education and infrastructureâ€”empowering communities and unlocking their full potential. I believe innovation must always serve humanityâ€”and that technology is at its best when it brings people together.

      <h2>Philosophy</h2>
      <p><strong>Love, Togetherness, and Legacy.</strong></p>
      <p>
        We believe that every tool we build should come from a place of loveâ€”for people, for our planet, and for generations to come. Innovation without compassion is incomplete. We strive to create a world where cooperation is more powerful than competition, where we design with empathy, and where the impact of our work is measured not just by revenue, but by lives improved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, we leave Earth better than we found it.
